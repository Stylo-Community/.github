* **✍️ Collaborative Blog:**
    A space for community members to share knowledge, experiences, and relevant articles, encouraging the exchange of ideas.


#### 📜 Our History

Stylo Community originated from a discontinued logo project. From there, one of the founders decided to create Stylo with the goal of helping developers facing difficulties in their own projects, as well as making all kinds of open-source content available.

Basically, the founder faced many challenges trying to maintain a project alone and, because of that, decided to support other developers who also need a foundation to start, in addition to encouraging the growth of the development community.
